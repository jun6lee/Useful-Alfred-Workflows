| [Download Workflow](https://github.com/jun6lee/Useful-Alfred-Workflows/blob/main/OneUpdater.alfredworkflow?raw=true)
| [Source Repo](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/OneUpdater) 
| üç∫Ô∏è [V√≠tor Galv√£o](https://github.com/vitorgalvao)

As the name suggests, this is OneUpdate to rule them all. An auto-update patch you can put into (almost) all of your Alfred workflows. With minimal set-up, it allows you to let each workflow update itself from source to the latest version automagically. Clear instruction on setup at the repo linked above.

![Setting up OneUpdater with Run Script](https://i.imgur.com/87AqLvI.gif)

The top lines must be set, and the rest of the code should be left untouched.

* `remote_info_plist` is the URL to the workflow‚Äôs up-to-date `info.plist` on a server.
* `workflow_url` and `download_type` work in tandem. `download_type` must be one of `direct`, `page`, or `github_release`.
  * When `direct`, `workflow_url` must be a direct link to a Workflow file.
  * When `page`, `workflow_url` must be a link to a download page.
  * When `github_release`, `workflow_url` must be of the form `username/repo`.
* `frequency_check` is the number of day between update checks. Set it to `0` when testing, so it fires on every use.

Example:

```
readonly remote_info_plist='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/master/ShortFilms/source/info.plist' 
readonly workflow_url='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/master/ShortFilms/ShortFilms.alfredworkflow'
readonly download_type='direct'
readonly frequency_check='4'
```
